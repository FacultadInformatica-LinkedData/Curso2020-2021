    RDF generated
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - Some values are not doubles (103.399.438.364.163). It seems that the values are incorrect.
        - Two individuals from different classes have the same URI because the naming strategy applied does not ensure uniqueness.
