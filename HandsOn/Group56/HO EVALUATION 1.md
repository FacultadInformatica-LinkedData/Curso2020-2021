    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - For representing values, you don't need to define a class and a datatype property associated to it. Just with the datatype property is enough.
    RDF generated
        - You are generating duplicated triples (plenty of them).
        - Corregir: Districto -> Distrito.
        - Identifiers are not numbers.
        - Solve the character encoding issues.
