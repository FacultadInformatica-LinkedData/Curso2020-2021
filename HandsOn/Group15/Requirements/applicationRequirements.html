    <h1>Application Requirements</h1>
    <h2>Application Description</h2>
    <p>This application allows users to search education centers and the after-school activities they offer in Madrid.</p>
    <p>The user interface will have the following requirements:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An exclusive window for the application will be displayed when it is executed</li>
        <li>It will have a map of the Community of Madrid</li>
        <li>The user will have two drop-down menus to select the municipality and type of centre</li>
        <li>The list of centres you return as a result will be displayed in a separate window from the previous one</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Application Requirements</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>The implementation of the application will be in Java</li>
        <li>The user interface will be in Java</li>
        <li>The application will be a desktop app for Windows (WPF)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Resource naming strategy</h2>
    <p>In general terms, the names that have been chosen are those that are standard and typical of the general specification.
        In cases where these names have not been chosen (mainly because we have had to create them ourselves)
        other names have been used which make it easier to identify them unambiguously.
    </p>
    <h2>Main bennefits of this app</h2>
    <p>The main benefit of this application will be that future users will be able to find all the necessary information to
    your children go to a centre with the characteristics they are looking for without having to search through its pages or
    move (through the
    pandemic in which we find ourselves is very difficult). </p>
    <p>The main benefit is that we can find centrally
    all the information to make the best decision.</p>
