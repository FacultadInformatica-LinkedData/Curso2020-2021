##Comments on the self-assessment##
_(If required)_
The CSV file we have used to be a xlsx but we converted it to a csv. We write it down here in case there are any compatibility issues.
Since our theme for the application is really concrete (electric scooters), we could only find one dataset.
The entities in the dataset are: districts, neighbourhood and scooter's brands. 
We have included a rough description of the interface yet to be developed.
