##Comments on the self-assessment##
- Since our csv was a transformed xlsx file it had some empty columns and rows as well as rows that had the total sum of scooters in each District and a column with the total sum of scooters in a neighbourhood and we deleted all of them to clean our dataset. Also we created a Place column and an Availability column as well as its respective URI columns.
- Our ontology was not built correctly so we decided to rewrite it and now it makes much more sense and it fits perfectly with our CSV file.
- Now our ontology has a Place class which has two subclasses: District and Neighbourhood.
- Now our ontology has a Availability class so that we can know the number of scooters available in a Place (District Neighbourhood) filtered by Company.
