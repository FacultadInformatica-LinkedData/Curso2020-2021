    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - The dataset is about scooters and none of the classes in the ontology cover that term. Maybe Place is not the best name?
        - The quantity of each provider must be represented with an intermediary class (n-ary relationship).
