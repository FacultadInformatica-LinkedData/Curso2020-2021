    Analysis
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the resource naming strategy.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - You cannot define classes in the OWL namespace.
        - Coordinates are not strings.
        - :Numero is not defined.
        - Use Protege to define the ontology to avoid having some errors.
        - Some classes are used but not defined.
    RDF generated
        - The RDF file does not follow the resource naming strategy.
        - The URI of an individual should be "readable" and have some meaning. An auto-increased integer does not satisfy this.
        - You cannot use slashes after hashes in URIs.
        - The RDF file does not contain individuals with labels.
        - The RDF file does not use some class and property URIs defined in the ontology.
