        <h1><b>Application Requirements</b></h1>
        <h2>Our idea of application is a way to see the nearest parking lot in a street or area</h2>
        <h2>Although,this is for now a preliminary idea and it may be changed in the future</h2>
        <h1><b>Description of the User Interface</b></h1>
        <p>
            The user will be able to input a street name, and the app 
            will display the nearest parking lot and its address.
            Also,there will be some instructions for the user to understand how the app works.
