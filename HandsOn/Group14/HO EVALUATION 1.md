Group 14
    General
        - The hands-on directory does not follow the required structure.
    Analysis
        - The datasetRequirements.html file is not correctly formatted.
        - The datasetRequirements.html file does not state how the selected datasets satisfy the requirements.
        - The applicationRequirements.html file is not correctly formatted.
        - The applicationRequirements.html file does not describe clearly what is the purpose of the application.
        - The applicationRequirements.html file does not include a description of the user interface.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        It is not a good practice to use in the resource naming strategy a version number, a year, etc.. The reason for this is that if you change the version/year of the ontology, all the URIs related to the base URI will change.
        - The resource naming strategy is not defined for individuals.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - The quantity of each species in each place must be represented with an intermediary class (n-ary relationship).
    RDF generated
        - Slashes cannot be used after hashes in the URIs.
        - Datatypes are missing.
