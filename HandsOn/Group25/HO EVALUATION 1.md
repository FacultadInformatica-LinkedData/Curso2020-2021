    General
    Analysis
        - The applicationRequirements.html file only contains the dataset requirements.
        - The applicationRequirements.html file does not describe clearly what is the purpose of the application.
        - The applicationRequirements.html file does not include a description of the user interface.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the license of the dataset to be generated.
        - The analysis.html file does not contain the resource naming strategy.
        - It is not clear which benefits will be obtained from linking those data with other datasets.
    Ontology
        - The extension of the ontology file must be .ttl.
        - The ontology does not open correctly in Protege.
        - The ontology does not contain object properties.
        - The domain and range of properties is not defined.
        - Better define properties with domain and range than restrictions on the classes.
    RDF generated
        - It could happen that two individuals from different classes have the same URI because the naming strategy does not ensure uniqueness.
        - Datatypes are missing.
        - A measurement is measured in different places. This is not correct, a measurement is from only one place.
        - The RDF file does not contain individuals with labels.
