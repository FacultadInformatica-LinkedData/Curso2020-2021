MAGNITUD,NOTACION,NOMBRE,NAME,WIKIDATA_ID,RESUMEN
1,SO2,Dióxido de Azufre,Sulfur dioxide,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q5282,"Sulfur dioxide is a toxic gas responsible for the smell of burnt matches. It is released naturally by volcanic activity and is produced as a by-product of copper extraction and the burning of fossil fuels."
6,CO,Monóxido de Carbono,Carbon monoxide,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2025,"Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless flammable gas that is slightly less dense than air. In the atmosphere, it is spatially variable and short-lived, having a role in the formation of ground-level ozone."
7,NO,Monóxido de Nitrógeno,Nitric oxide (radical),https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207843,"Nitric oxide is a colorless gas. Nitric oxide is a free radical, i.e., it has an unpaired electron. An important intermediate in industrial chemistry, nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms."
8,NO2,Dióxido de Nitrógeno,Nitrogen dioxide,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q207895,"Nitrogen dioxide is a chemical compound. NO2 is an intermediate in the industrial synthesis of nitric acid, millions of tons of which are produced each year for use primarily in the production of fertilizers. At higher temperatures it is a reddish-brown gas."
9,PM2.5,Partículas <2.5 μm,Particulates <2.5 μm,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q498957,"PM2.5 are very small particles in the air that have a diameter of 2.5 micrometers. Particulates, one of the six criteria for air pollutants of the U.S. EPA is a mixture that can include organic chemicals, dust, soot, and metals. These particles can come from all kinds of combustion, with that of cars, trucks, factories, wood burning, agricultural burning and other activities."
10,PM10,Partículas <10 μm,Particulates <10 μm,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q498957,"PM10 refers to small solid or liquid particles of dust, ash, soot, metallic particles, cement or pollen, dispersed in the atmosphere, and whose aerodynamic diameter is less than 10 µm. Air pollution by particulate matter is the alteration of the natural composition of the atmosphere as a consequence of the entry into suspension of particles, either by natural causes or by human action."
12,NOx,Óxidos de Nitrógeno,Nitrogen oxide,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q424418,"Nitric oxide is a colorless gas. Nitric oxide is a free radical, i.e., it has an unpaired electron. An important intermediate in industrial chemistry, nitric oxide forms in combustion systems and can be generated by lightning in thunderstorms."
14,O3,Ozono,Ozone,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q36933,"Ozone is an inorganic molecule. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet (UV) light and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation."
20,TOL,Tolueno,Toluene,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q15779,"Toluene is an aromatic hydrocarbon. It is a colorless, water-insoluble liquid with the smell associated with paint thinners. Toluene is predominantly used as an industrial feedstock and a solvent.As the solvent in some types of paint thinner, permanent markers, contact cement and certain types of glue, toluene is sometimes used as a recreational inhalant."
30,BEN,Benceno,Benzene,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q2270,"Benzene is an organic chemical compound. Benzene is a colorless and highly flammable liquid with a sweet smell, and is responsible for the aroma around petrol (gasoline) stations. It is used primarily as a precursor to the manufacture of chemicals with more complex structure, such as ethylbenzene and cumene, of which billions of kilograms are produced annually."
35,EBE,Etilbenceno,Ethylbenzene,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q409184,"Ethylbenzene is an organic compound. It is a highly flammable, colorless liquid with an odor similar to that of gasoline. This monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbon is important in the petrochemical industry as an intermediate in the production of styrene, the precursor to polystyrene, a common plastic material."
42,TCH,Hidrocarburos totales (hexano),Hexane,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q150440,"Hexane is a straight-chain alkane. Hexane is a significant constituent of gasoline. It is a colorless liquid, odorless when pure, and with boiling points approximately 69 °C. It is widely used as a cheap, relatively safe, largely unreactive, and easily evaporated non-polar solvent."
43,CH4,Metano,Methane,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q37129,"Methane is a chemical compound and is the main constituent of natural gas. The relative abundance of methane on Earth makes it an economically attractive fuel, although capturing and storing it poses technical challenges due to its gaseous state under normal conditions for temperature and pressure."
44,NMHC,Hidrocarburos no metánicos (hexano),Non-Methane volatile organic compound,https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16963326,"Non-Methane Volatile Organic Compounds (NMVOC) do not include methane (CH4), since its reactivity in the atmosphere is negligible. NMVOCs (mainly hydrocarbons) cause the formation of tropospheric ozone by reacting with sunlight."
