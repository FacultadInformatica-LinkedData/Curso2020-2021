## Comments on the self-assessment ##

### v1
* Two JSON documents are uploaded since we had two different types of datasets.
* Data refining actions taken:
  * Removing redundant columns (province, town; every data is from Madrid).
  * Formatting numeric columns (station or magnitude codes, dates, values).
  * Splitting one-full row (with up to 30 magnitude measured) to up to 30 rows each.
  * Filling down the values for the new rows created.
  * Transposing data in order to merge the different types of datasets.
  * Normalize the columns of data and merging the datasets.
