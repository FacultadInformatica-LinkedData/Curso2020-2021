    Ontology
        - Not all the datatype properties have literal values, some require other datatypes.
    RDF generated
        - The RDF file does not use the class and property URIs defined in the ontology.
        - Empty values are inserted.
        - Some entities could be encoded as instances and not strings.
        - Datatypes are missing.
