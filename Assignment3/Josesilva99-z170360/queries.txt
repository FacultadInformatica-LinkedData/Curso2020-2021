SELECT DISTINCT ?prop WHERE{
?poli rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?poli ?prop ?val.
}


2. Get all the properties, except rdf:type, that can be applied
to instances of the Politician class

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop WHERE{
?poli rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?poli ?prop ?val.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type).
}

3. Which different values exist for the properties, except
rdf:type, of the instances of the Politician class?

SELECT DISTINCT ?val WHERE{
?poli rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?poli ?prop ?val.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type).
}


4. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be
applied to instances of the Politician class, which different
values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop ?val WHERE{
?poli rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?poli ?prop ?val.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type).
}


5. For each of the properties, except rdf:type, that can be
applied to instances of the Politician class, how many
distinct values do they take in those instances?

SELECT DISTINCT ?prop COUNT(DISTINCT ?val) WHERE{
?poli rdf:type <http://dbpedia.org/ontology/Politician>.
?poli ?prop ?val.
FILTER (?prop != rdf:type).
